Codex is developed by nine highly experienced protocol and software developers, distributed systems experts, and ZK-cryptography researchers with backgrounds in academia and across the mainstream tech and web3 sectors.

The contributors working on Codex are split into the subgroups below:

- **Codex general:** Staffed by a project lead and a project manager with vast collective web3 experience.

- **Codex marketplace:** Staffed by a development lead and two senior distributed systems engineers.

- **Codex client:** Staffed by a senior protocol and network engineer that draw on experience with mainstream companies like Philips and others.

- **Codex research:** Staffed by two senior distributed systems researchers with backgrounds in academia and with the Ethereum Foundation.

Codex is looking for more contributors to help build the network and currently has multiple openings for protocol engineers and other positions. As an open-source public goods project Codex also welcomes community contributions.
